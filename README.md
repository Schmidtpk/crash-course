# crash-course

Welcome to the course. There are no prerequisites for the course. If you want to use R on your own machine in the future, I recommend installing [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) before the course. For the rest, the local PCs can be used.

Download the prepared [Rscript](https://github.com/Schmidtpk/crash-course/blob/main/Rscript.R).

For additional content, you can check out the following introduction by [Saghir](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-in-R?tab=readme-ov-file). [PDF](https://github.com/saghirb/Getting-Started-in-R/raw/master/Getting-Started-in-R.pdf).
